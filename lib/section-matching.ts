/**
 * Homepage section configuration.
 *
 * Each homepage rail is defined purely by the catalogue categories that feed
 * it — no name/keyword guessing. A rail's products are every product whose
 * `category` is the rail's root category or any of its descendants.
 *
 * Two things about the live catalogue make the `categorySlugs` list necessary:
 *
 *  1. Parent categories hold no products themselves (products live on leaves),
 *     so a rail must include the whole subtree of its root.
 *  2. A number of categories were created flat at the root instead of under
 *     their proper parent ("Security Camera", "Ethernet Switch", "Mouses"), so
 *     each rail also lists those strays explicitly.
